# Installation on Android

## Legacy FusionInventory Agent package

Historical [FusionInventory for Android](http://fusioninventory.org/news/2011/09/13/first-release-for-fusioninventory-agent-for-android.html) is no more available on Google Play.

By the way, you still can get it from the github release section: [FusionInventory for Android](https://github.com/fusioninventory/fusioninventory-android/releases/download/1.0.1/FusionInventory-1.0.1.apk).
